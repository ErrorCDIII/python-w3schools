What placeholders are used when dealing with f-strings?
    {}

Use the price variable and f-string syntax to display the price 
with two decimals:
    price = 59
    txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"
    print(txt)

Use an if statement inside the f-string placeholders ro return
'perfect' if the price is 100, and 'ok' if it is not
    price = 100
    txt = f"It is {'perfect' if price == 100 else 'ok'}"
    print(txt)

Consider the following code:
    price = 1000
    txt = f'The price is {price:,} dollars'
    print(txt)

    The price is 1,000 dollars
