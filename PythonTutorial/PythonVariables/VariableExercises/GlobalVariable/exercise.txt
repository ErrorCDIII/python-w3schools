Consider the following code:
    x = 'awesome'
    def myFunc():
        x = 'fantastic'
    myFunc()
    print('Python is ' + x)

    Python is awesome

Insert the correct keyword to make the variable x belong to the global scope.
    def myFunc():
        global x
        x = "fantastic"

Consider the following code:
    x = 'awesome'
    def myFunc():
        global x
        x = 'fantastic'
    myFunc()
    print('Python is ' + x)

    Python is fantastic
