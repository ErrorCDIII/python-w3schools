# Escape Character
# An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

# This will generate an error -> double quotes inside double quotes
# txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."

# This will prevent the previous error
txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
print(txt)
