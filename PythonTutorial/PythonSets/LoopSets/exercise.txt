What is a correct syntax for looping though the items of a set?
    for x in {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}:
        print(x)

Insert the missing part of the for loop below to loop through the items of a set
    myset = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}
    for x in myset:
        print(x)

True or False. Sets are unordered, so when yu loop through the items,
the order will be totally random
