Consider the following code:
    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
    newList = [x for x in fruits if x == 'banana']

    ['banana']

Fill the missing parts to complete the list comprehension:
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    newList = [x for x in fruits]

Consider the following code:
    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
    newList = ['apple' for x in fruits]

    ['apple', 'apple', 'apple']
