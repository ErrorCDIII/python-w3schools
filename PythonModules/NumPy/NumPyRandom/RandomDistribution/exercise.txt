Consider the following code:
    
    x = random.choice([5,2, 7], p=[0.1, 0.3, 0.0], size=100)
    print(x)

Which one of the following numbers will never occur in the result?

    7

Which one of the following code lines will return a 2 Dimensional array?

    x = random.choice([3, 5, 6, 9], p=[0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.0], size=(3, 5))

True or False.
The probability is set by a number between 1 and 0, where 1 means that
