Consider the following code:
    import numy as np
    arr = np.array(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    for x in arr:
        print('Hello ' + x)
What will be the printed result?

    Hello a
    Hello b
    Hello c

Consider the following code:
    import numpy as np
    arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    for x in arr:
        print(x)
What will be the printed result?

    [1 2 3]
    [4 5 6]

Consider the following code:
    import numpy as np
    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
    for x in np.nditer(arr[::2]):
        print(x)
What will be the printed result?
