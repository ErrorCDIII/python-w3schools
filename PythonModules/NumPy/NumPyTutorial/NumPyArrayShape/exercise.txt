Consider the following code:
    import numpy as np
    arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    print(arr.shape)

    (2, 3)

Use the correct NumPy syntax to check the shape of an array
    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

    print(arr.shape)

The return value of arr.shape is represented in a certain data type.
Which one?
    tuple
