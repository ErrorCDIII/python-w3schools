Consider the following code:
    import numpy as np
    original_array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    x = original_array.copy()
    x[0] = 5
    print(original_array)
What will be the printed result?

    [1, 2, 3]

Use the correct method to make a copy of the array
    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3,  4, 5])

    x = arr.copy()

Use the correct method to make a view of the array
    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

    x = arr.view()
