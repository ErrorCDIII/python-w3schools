Consider the following code:
    import numpy as np
    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
    print(arr[:2])

    [1 2]

Insert the correct slicing syntax to print the following selection
of the array:
Everything from (including) the second item to (not including) the
fifth item
    arr = np.array([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40])

    print(arr[1:4])

Insert the correct slicing syntax to print the following selection
of the array:
Everything from (including) the third item to (not including) the
fifth item
    arr = np.array([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40])

    print(arr[2:4])

Insert the correct slicing syntax to print the following selection
of the array:
Every other item from (including) the sencond item to (not including)
the fith item
Tip: use the step syntax

    arr = np.array([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40])

    print(arr[1:4:2])

Insert the correct slicing syntax to print the following selection
of the array:
Every other item from the entire array
Tipe: use the step syntax

    arr = np.array([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40])

    print(arr[::2])
