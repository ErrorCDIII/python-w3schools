Consider the following code:
    import numpy as np
    arr = np.array([15, 38, 41, 46])
    x = np.where(arr%2 == 1)
    print(x)
What will be the printed result?

    (array[0, 2],)

Use the correct NumPy method to find all items with the value 4
    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4])

    x = np.where(arr == 4)

Which NumPy function can be used to find where the specified 
elements belong in the arrat? (sorted)
    searchsorted()
